## ***Summary***
> I'm 25  years old and currently i work as a production documentation assistant. This is a cool job as i need to communicate a lot as well as to create new documentation. But to learn something new sounds much more interesting. I wouldn't describe myself as a very fast learner as i prefer to learn everything thoroughly.
